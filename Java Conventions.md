## Source file

##### ●　File name

The source file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the top-level class it contains, plus the .java extension.

##### ●　File encoding

Source files are encoded in UTF-8.

##### ●　Special escape sequences

For any character that has a special escape sequence (\b, \t, \n, \f, \r, \", \' and \\), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding octal (e.g. \012) or Unicode (e.g. \u000a) escape.
